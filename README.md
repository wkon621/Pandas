# Pandas
Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.  

In my personal opinion, is it a well-structered package that tremendously facilitates data analysis and can be learned in a fast manner through continuous practices. 

You can find commonly-use cases of pandas in each folder but certainly there are other methods for you to explore.    

Suggestions and collaborations are more than welcome. Please open an issue or make a PR. :)  

Let's start learning !!
